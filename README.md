### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [procedural art](https://github.com/not-napoleon/plotterart) in python
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning kubernetes
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data engineering, tech culture, or science fiction
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (although I also answer to they/them)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Computers are just sand that we taught to think, but the atoms in that sand were forged in the heart of stars.

I guess we're doing this now.

Hi, I'm Mark.  I'm a tech industry professional, photography hobbyist, and casually bad player of video games.

Someone once gave me life changing advice:  

> You have to keep doing stuff, or you die. Look at Napoleon. He did a lot of stuff, but what's he done lately?
> Nothing, because he's dead. That's what dead means, you stop doing stuff.

So, I try not to be like Napoleon.
